# Coffee-Quality-Analysis

Coffee is one of the most popular beverages in the world and one of the most traded commodities.
Several factors affect the quality of coffee. Among some of these are the species and variety of the coffee plant used, the soil and altitude where the coffee is grown, and the post-harvest processing methods used.
The datasets provided consist of rating of multiple coffees of Arabica and Robusta coffee beans. We would like you to analyse the data provided and use it to:
-	Understand which factors contribute to a high coffee quality score
-	Create a model that predicts the quality score of a coffee
-	Provide a recommendation to a prospective coffee farmer on what to consider to produce a high quality coffee in Central America
